### 2FAuth v5, the not-so-major release

Why? Because most of the changes are internal and come from the Vue 3 migration. I choose the long way, the one where all components had to be rewritten to adopt the new Vue Composition API and where the whole architecture has been rethought. Thus, despite all that work, almost nothing has changed on the surface.

But it was a necessary step, especially because Vue 2 will reach End Of Life on the end of 2023. Now 2FAuth is also better prepared for futur enhancements.

Ok, so is there anything new?
Yes, SSO.

Not so bad, right ?

The feature, bootstrapped by [@indyKoning](https://github.com/indykoning) with an OpenID provider, has been completed and now provides a Github provider as well. I plan to add more providers, tell me in the discussion which ones you would like to see. If you need help, the [docs site](https://docs.2fauth.app/security/authentication/sso/) has been updated to guide you through the setup process.

v5 also comes with the following.
